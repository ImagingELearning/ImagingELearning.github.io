# Getting started with neutron imaging tutorial notebooks

## Introduction
This part of the IAEA e-learning package for neutron imaging is implemented using jupyter-notebooks. 
The notebooks are interactive documents with embedded python code. This concept allows you to modify 
the computations and see what happens, you can even try the demonstrated concepts on your own data to see what happens.
Some of the tutorial notebooks are implemented as exercises where you are guided step by step to 
implement your own python code. These notebooks have a solution notebook accompanying them, in which a
solution is presented. You can chose yourself what benefits your learning and your python skills best. 

## Using the notebooks
There are two main approaches to using the tutorial notebooks; by installing jupyter-notebook on your computer or by running the notebooks on Google Colab.
By installing jupyter locally you have the most freedom to work with the material but if you for examply don't want to fill your hard drive with yet another 
software package there is the Colab solution which you try without installing anything locally.

### Setting up jupyter locally
Jupyter is mostly easiest to install through the Anaconda environment which you can download freely. 
By installing it, you have very good starting point for data analysis using python. It includes a large 
collection of packages preinstalled has a packet manager to help you installing more packages if needed.
Anaconda can be installed on their [homepage](https://www.anaconda.com/download). Download and install 
the version for your operating system.
